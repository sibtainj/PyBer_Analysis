# Challenge 5 - PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to identify the sum of fares for each of the city type. This analysis will also allow the owners at PyBer a better understanding on the total rides, total drivers as well as some averages of fares per ride and per driver. This analyis consist of a summary Data Frame as well as chart.

## Results

### Summary Data Frame

The above Summary Data Frame displays the following: Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average fare per Driver. This is all grouped by city type.

Based on the above summary we can conclude that there are many more rides in the Uban city type as opposed to the other city types.

Due to the high volume of rides the average fare is also lower in the Urban city type.

### Sum of Weekly fare for each city type

The above chart displays the sum of weekly fares by each city type.

It is very clear that the weekly fares are much higher for the Urban city type. Towards the end of the month of February the sum of weekly fares went up for all 3 city types.

## Summary

Based on the above analysis here are 3 recommendations for the PyBer CEO:

1. They should consider increasing the number of drivers in the Rural area. This will in turn lower the average fare per ride. By doing this more people will opt to use PyBer in the rural area. In the long run PyBer will increase their revenue by doing this.

2. The demand of rides is very high in the Urban area, therefore I would recommend to increase the number of drivers in this area as well. They should also increase the fare per rider since the demand is high and passenger will use the service anyways.

3. Based on the chart Pyber needs to have many more driver in the month of February for the Urban city type, as the weekly sum of fares is increasing in that month. Some of the Rural and Suburban drives can be used in the Urban area since their weekly fares went down in that time period.
